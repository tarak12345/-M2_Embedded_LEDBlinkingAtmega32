## INTRODUCTION

-The blinking LED circuit is like the electronics version. It's a simple electronic circuit that gives you a visual cue if it works. ... The goal is to make a Light Emitting Diode (LED) blink


## SWOT ANALYSIS

### STRENGTH

-LEDs are extremely energy efficient and consume up to 90% less power than incandescent bulbs

-Since LEDs use only a fraction of the energy of an incandescent light bulb there is a dramatic decrease in power costs

### WEEKNESS

-Overheating can cause reduced lamp life

### OPPURTUNITY

-Safety will also improve because unsafe situation will be easily predicted. 

### TREADS
-High up-front costs

-Performance standardization has not yet been streamlined

## 4W & 1H

### WHY

-LED blinking circuit can be used as flashing beacon

-It can be used in operation theaters or offices as an indication that you are engaged in work


### WHAT

-The blinking LED circuit is like the electronics version of the “Hello World”-program.

-It's a simple electronic circuit that gives you a visual cue if it works.The goal is to make a Light Emitting Diode (LED) blink

### WHEN

-LED blinking circuit can be used in signaling purpose (It can be used as signal for help, if you are in danger) LED blinking circuit can be used as flashing beacon



### HOW
-The Blinking LED is a passive device that converts the light energy into an electrical signal output
